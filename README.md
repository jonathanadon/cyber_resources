# Cyber Resources
A simple but hopefully useful reference of knowledgeable resources in Cybersecurity. The goal isn't to cover ever aspect of the subject but to note what resources that I found useful in my journey and share to others that may be interested.

Note: This is not a paid advertisement for the individuals or companies listed. I just think they do some cool stuff.
